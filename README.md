# Image_Classifier_using-Pytorch_AIND
In this project, I built a Python application that can train an deep learning flower image classifier on a flowers dataset using Pytorch framework. Then, I predicted new flower images using the trained model (Testdata images) to inspect the model accuracy.
<br>In the first part of the project, I implemented my code in a Jupyter notebook. 
<br>In the second part, I converted the code to a Python application (I created a python script) that runs form the command line.
